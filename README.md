# bb-8-circle

I wanted my [Sphero BB-8](http://www.sphero.com/starwars) to accompany me to work and notify me of build status as reported by [Circle CI](https://circleci.com/).

## Setup
Make a copy of `config-sample.js` and fill it in with the proper information. Find your BB-8's connection info as detailed [here](https://github.com/orbotix/sphero.js#connecting-to-bb-8ollie).

## Usage
Run `npm install` and then `node main.js`.

## Notes
Even though this code is written with the BB-8 Sphero in mind, it should work with all Spheros supported by the JavaScript SDK
